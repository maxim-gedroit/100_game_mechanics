# 100 game mechanics
Implementation of the 100 most famous game mechanics

Hi all! I am starting a marathon of implementing 100 well-known game mechanics based on the Unity game engine and the C# programming language.
A list of these mechanics is freely available on the Internet. The main goal of this marathon is to try to implement all the mechanics in various ways.
Please do not judge strictly for the quality of the code, since many of these mechanics have never been implemented before. Try to implement all things as simply as possible.
In this project, I neglect the basic principles of programming (OOP, SOLID, etc.) in favor of the speed of writing mechanics. Maybe someday I'll get it right.)
I will consider all your ideas and suggestions!
I hope this repository will be useful to everyone who needs new game features in projects.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Health as a currency

You need to collect lives to successfully complete the game.

2. Fog of war

The further the player goes, the more the map is visible.

3. Lack of menu, or menu inscribed in the game world

If you are tired of canvas and want to make a new menu, then this mechanic is definitely for you!

4. Red barrels

Standard barrel explosion.

---

5. Sandbox

In the mechanics of the sandbox, I took for the main idea - the capture and dragging of objects.

6. Flexible creation of custom spells or weapons

From three figures you can make 6 types of weapons.

7. Saving in bed or in the house of a game character

8. Bullet hell

For example, some final boss with different types of bullets.

---

9. Complicated relationships between NPCs

I decided to implement the relationship between the NPCs as in minecraft between the villagers and the invaders.

10. Change level color

Changing the color of the map was achieved by switching shaders.

11. Ghost after dead

The animation of the appearance was made through coroutine and a custom shader.

---

12. Death depends on time

The approaching death depends on time. In this case, a platformer was made with lava that fills the room.

13. Bridge constructor

When implementing this mechanic, I made a mesh generation.

15. Rythm based

Standard mechanics to have time to press a certain key to the rhythm of the music.

16. Player statistics

Here it was decided to make statistics as in ordinary races that are smoothly sorted in the list.

---

17. Idle

This mechanic is that when you are not playing the game, changes still occur. These things are done by manipulating dates.

18. Farm

The basic principle of the farm - earned and paid.

---

19. Programming

The main idea is to do it the way redstone works in minecraft.
